# steven_avery_case
 The goal of the website it to publish documents relating to the trials of Steven Avery, subject of Netflix's Making A Murderer. This is the first website I began to build with the mindset of it being able to fit seamlessly into mobile.
It was created to practice Twitter's Bootstrap frame to make a functional, document-heavy site.
